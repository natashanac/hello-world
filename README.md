Learning to create a repository

Hello World!

This is Natasha. I have a degree in Language Studies (English and French) but found out that I have another language interest... the coding language!
I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQL with the help of Mimo, SoloLearn, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp and anything I can find on Google about coding...
